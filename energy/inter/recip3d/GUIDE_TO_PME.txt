Users Guide to PME

Intro
-----
   The particle mesh ewald method (PME) generates an approximation to the 
structure factor and hence the reciprocal space part of the ewald summation
energy using a spline interpolation and an FFT.  There are two
parameters that determine the accuracy of the approximation,
the order of the spline interpolation and grid spacing of the FFT.
These two parameters must be adjusted to achieve the highest accuracy
for the least cpu time. The order of the interpolation must be an
even number greater than or equal to 4.
 
a) Standard parameters
 \ewald_pme_on{on}       Turn on PME
 \ewald_kmax_pme{7}      Determines the PME grid spacing ( >=\ewald_kmax{})
 \ewald_interp_pme{4}    The order of the PME interpolation (>=4 and even).

b) Respa parameters
 \ewald_respa_pme_on{on}     Turn on RESPA PME
 \ewald_respa_kmax_pme{7}    Determines the RESPA PME grid spacing 
                                          ( >=\ewald_respa_kmax{}
 \ewald_respa_interp_pme{4}  The order of the RESPA PME interpolation 
                                           (>=4 and even).

Using PME without respa (respa_steps_lrf = 1)
---------------------------------------------

  1) Choose an \ewald_alpha{} and \ewald_kmax{} (see optimization manual)
                (\ewald_alpha{} = \ewald_kmax{} is a good choice).
  2) Use the debug option with ewald_pme{off}:
      a) Get the timing for the standard ewald routine and record vrecip. 
      b) Check the accuracy of vrecip by doubling ewald_kmax and
         running the code again.
  3) Use the debug option with ewald_pme{on} and the desired
     \ewald_alpha{} and \ewald_kmax{}.
     a) Adjust kmax_pme and interp_pme to obtain the same accuracy
        as the standard ewald routine for vrecip. kmax_pme is greater or equal
        to kmax_ewald and interp_pme >=4.
  4) Use the faster of the two methods, standard ewald or PME in your
     calculations.
   
Using PME without respa (respa_steps_lrf > 1)
---------------------------------------------

   1) If \ewald_respa_pme_on{off} is chosen, this is equivalent
      to choosing ewald_respa_kmax = ewald_kmax. The full reciprocal
      space energy is calculated respa_steps_lrf times per time step.
   2) If \ewald_respa_pme_on{on} is chosen with ewald_respa_kmax=0,
      the full reciprocal space energy is calculated once per time step.
   3) Adjust the parameters \respa_steps_lrf{}
                            \ewald_respa_kmax_pme{}
                            \ewald_respa_interp_pme{}
                            \ewald_respa_kmax{})
      to achieve the desired level of energy conservation with
      the smallest cpu time. (See the optimization guide).
      I am not sure what is going to work the best here.
      However, it looks like the PME is pretty fast 
      and just like keeping \ewald_respa_pme_on{off} should work fairly well.
